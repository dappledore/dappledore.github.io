<p class="p1">Drawbridge Soft DoBike Privacy Policy</p>
<p class="p1">Privacy Policy for apps developed and published by Drawbridge Soft</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Our Privacy Policy is in addition to any terms, conditions or policies agreed to between you and the store when you purchased and/or download our apps. We are not responsible for the store's collection or use of your user data and information.</p>
<p class="p1">1. We respect and value your privacy. We do not collect personally identifiable information about users of our apps (your name, address, phone number, email address etc.). We use the Docomo username and password to reserve bikes only and do not store this data on any servers. The username and password is stored locally in the app only for the purposes of convenience, so multiple requests for user data are not required and this data is not known to us.</p>
<p class="p1">2. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.</p>
<p class="p1">3. We collect some anonymous usage information to help us improve our apps and services. We use third party analytics services that may collect data as a device type and OS, an app identifier, unique device identifiers, app session time, events and lengths.</p>
<p class="p1">4. We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.</p>
<p class="p1">5. We do not allow advertising companies to collect data through our service for ad targeting.</p>
<p class="p1">6. Some of our free apps may contain non consumable in-app purchases. Some apps have external links to the store where you purchased the app to help you to find more about our other apps or to our website.</p>
<p class="p1">7. Sometimes we provide links to third-party web sites from our website (not from our mobile apps). We are not responsible for their privacy policy or their content.</p>
<p class="p1">8. If you contact us with a question about our mobile apps or with a support question, we may receive your email address or other information you provide. We use these information only to answer your questions or provide support to you.</p>
<p class="p1">9. We also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (a) with your express consent, (b) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law (c) at the request of governmental authorities, or (d) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets provided that use of your email address is otherwise in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="p1">10. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please contact us.</p>
